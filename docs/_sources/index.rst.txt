Graph4NLP is a library utilizing deep learning on graphs to carry out natural language processing tasks. We believe
this library will boost research in relevant fields. This library has the following advantages:

- End-to-End supporting: Graph4NLP implements every necessary components in the pipeline of natural language processing tasks.

- Large coverage: Graph4NLP implements all popular methods in graph deep learning.

- To be added here.
